            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Aston University with a passion for coding, web development, and all things tech. 
                I love exploring new technologies, from building responsive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solving complex problems with Java and Python. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Outside of academics, I’ve been involved in projects like the Engineering for People Design Challenge, where my team won first place for developing a 
                sustainable solution to a real-world problem. I’m also an active member of the Aston Computer Science Society (ACSS) and the Computer Science Industry Club, 
                constantly pushing myself to learn and grow through coding challenges, hackathons, and workshops. 
                As I look toward a career in software engineering or web development, I’m excited to apply my skills and collaborate on innovative projects. 
                Whether it’s building a sleek web application or crafting algorithms, I’m always eager for a new challenge!
